# Introduction
This is a Neural Network from scratch project.

It Also contains homework projects from **NCU Neural Nework Course**.

You can checkout output to play with each homework results.

You can also see NN folder to use my implenentation of neural network.

Note that this is a practice of building network from sracth.

Performace is not optimized.
